# egfr_binder_design

This project uses the RFDiffusion Colab Tool open-sourced by the Baker Lab/Institute of Protein Design to design 64 unique protein binders that target the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, a membrane protein that is often overexpressed in cancerous cells.

Please note that the almost all of the work went into identifying target chains, conditioning the protein structure, etc. and not into writing the code.
